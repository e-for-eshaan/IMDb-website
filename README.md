# [IMDb Clone](https://e-for-eshaan.github.io/IMDb-website/)

This is a clone of IMDb, a popular online database of movies, TV shows, and celebrities. The project is built using jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Overview

The IMDb Clone project aims to replicate some of the features and functionality of the original IMDb website. It retrieves movie data from the TMDB API and displays popular movies, theater movies, and dramas. It also fetches entertainment news from the News API and allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API.
