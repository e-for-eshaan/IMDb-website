# IMDb Clone

This is a clone of IMDb, a popular online database of movies, TV shows, and celebrities. The project is built using jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Overview

The IMDb Clone project aims to replicate some of the features and functionality of the original IMDb website. It retrieves movie data from the TMDB API and displays popular movies, theater movies, and dramas. It also fetches entertainment news from the News API and allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API.

## Features

- Displaying popular movies: The project retrieves a list of popular movies from the TMDB API and displays them on the home page. Each movie is represented as a card with an image and title.

- Displaying theater movies: The project fetches a list of movies currently in theaters from the TMDB API and displays them on the home page. Only movies with a poster image are shown.

- Displaying dramas: The project retrieves a list of drama movies released in 2021 from the TMDB API and displays them on the home page.

- Fetching entertainment news: The project fetches the top entertainment news articles from the News API and displays them as cards with images and titles.

- Movie search: Users can search for movies using the search form. The project uses the OMDb API to fetch search results based on the entered text and displays them as cards with images and titles.

- Movie details: Clicking on a movie card displays detailed information about the movie, including the title, release date, genre, votes, popularity, and plot.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the IMDb Clone website.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the website.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that includes the logic for fetching movie data from APIs, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the webpage.
